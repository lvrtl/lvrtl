- 👋 Hi, I’m @lvrtl, Laura Rintoul!
- 👀 I'm a software engineer with a first class master's in mathmatical physics from Heriot-Watt university
- ❓  I'm interested in programming, and have experience in Python, Spring Boot, Angular and MATLAB
- 🌱 I'm currently working at Accolite Digital
- My master's project was on predicting the effects of phonons on Quantum Devices
In which python was being used to simulate how electrons interact with various nanostructures' phonon spectral densities, for 
predicting how their behaviour will be affected by them using iQUAPI hamiltonian time evolution simulations.
