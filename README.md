- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lvrtl, Laura Rintoul!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a Master's year physics graduate with interest in programming, and experience in Python and MATLAB ðŸ˜Š
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on my Master's project at Heriot-Watt University, predicting the effects of phonons on Quantum Devices
In which python is being used to simulate how electrons interact with various nanostructures' phonon spectral densities, for 
predicting how their behaviour will be affected by them using iQUAPI hamiltonian time evolution simulations.
